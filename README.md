# Convert-Text-to-Speech-in-AI-python
Text to speech is a process to convert any text into voice. Text to speech project takes words on digital devices and convert them into audio with a button click or finger touch. Text to speech python project is very helpful for people who are struggling with reading.

Project Prerequisites
To implement this project, we will use the basic concepts of Python, Tkinter, gTTS, and playsound libraries.

Tkinter is a standard GUI Python library that is one of the fastest and easiest ways to build GUI applications using Tkinter.
gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) is a Python library, which is a very easy library that converts the text into audio.
The playsound module is used to play audio files. With this module, we can play a sound file with a single line of code.
To install the required libraries, you can use pip install command:
<p style="color:green">pip install tkinter</p>
<p style="color:green">pip install gTTS</p>
<p style="color:green">pip install playsound</p>
